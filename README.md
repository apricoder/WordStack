# WordStack

This Android application is designed to help people with medium or advanced level of knowledge 
of foreign language to develop their language skills focusing on rapidly expanding their vocabulary.

Based on adapted Leitner system this app allows to quickly learn words like flash cards.
Among greatest benefits there is an automatic translation and possibility to hear proper 
pronounciation of words or frazes.
